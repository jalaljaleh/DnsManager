<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project
###  Fast, Free & Open DNS Controller
DNS Manager is a lightweight and powerful Windows application that helps you easily **change your DNS settings** with just one click.

It comes with a curated list of **the best DNS servers**, including performance-focused and censorship-bypassing ones like **Shecan** and **Electro DNS**, allowing you to experience the web like a user in **Europe** — even if you're located in **Iran**, **Russia**, or other countries with restricted access.

 <br />

## 🌐 Why Use DNS Manager?

✔️ **Bypass Censorship & Filters**  
Unlock blocked services like **Instagram**, **YouTube**, **Google Play**, and even **GitHub**, which may be restricted in your country.

✔️ **Experience as a European User**  
Some DNS services (like Shecan) simulate a European user location, bypassing Google restrictions such as Play Store bans or Studio access.

✔️ **Ultra-Simple UI**  
Switch between DNS servers with a single click. The application displays status, current DNS, and full server descriptions.

✔️ **Custom DNS Support**  
Easily **add**, **edit**, or **remove** your own DNS profiles — no tech knowledge needed.

✔️ **Optimized for Windows**  
No background services, no resource overhead. DNS Manager is a small, efficient app built with C# and WPF.


 <br />


## 🚀 Built-in DNS Providers

Here are just a few of the servers included:

- **Shecan** — Great for bypassing **Google and etc-related bans** in countries like Iran & russian
- **Electro (Gaming)** — Tuned for low-latency gaming and streaming 
- **Cloudflare** — Fast, privacy-first global DNS  
- **Google DNS** — Stable and secure  
- **Quad9** — Security-filtered DNS to block malware and phishing  
- **OpenNIC / UncensoredDNS** — Community-run, anti-censorship DNS  
... and many more



 <br />

## 🔐 How DNS Helps Bypass Internet Censorship

DNS servers translate domain names (like youtube.com) into IP addresses.  
By default, your country’s DNS might filter or block domains. DNS Manager **routes requests through external DNS providers**, avoiding this censorship completely — without the need for a VPN.

Think of it as **"legal VPN behavior"** with zero overhead and system-wide effects.



 <br /> <br /> <br />
